I&amp;rsquo;ve laid out all the information below on how you can use NFC Tags to automate other apps and devices as well!
I really like using Near Field Communication (NFC) for home or device based automations because it is really cheap and the possibilities are endless as you can place them in any environmental condition and on almost any physical object.</description></item><item><title>How-to normalize home volume levels with Node-RED</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/how-to-normalize-home-volume-levels-with-node-red/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2020 08:11:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/how-to-normalize-home-volume-levels-with-node-red/</guid><description>This post is going to cover normalizing all media_player volume levels with Home Assistant and Node-RED. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend reading my previous blog post on sending Text-to-Speech notifications which dives a bit deeper on the optional accessibility Subflow this Flow consumes.

In the sections below I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using Amazon Alexa Media Player Integration to send TTS notifications. Please note you can easily switch out the TTS integration to the one of your choosing and still use this Subflow (with a few tweaks).
This is one of my favorite Subflows as it can be used easily in a lot of automations.</description></item><item><title>Let's talk about smart home accessibility</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/lets-talk-about-smart-home-accessibility/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 01:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/lets-talk-about-smart-home-accessibility/</guid><description>I define accessibility as a critical necessity to be inclusive to everyone. No matter how big or small the task, anyone should be able complete the task at hand regardless of the disability (e.g., vision, hearing, mobility, device access, language, etc).

Home Assistant has stated they will no longer support this installation method but there currently is no other way to use external storage.
I recently upgraded my Home Assistant server to an Intel NUC 10 Performance Kit (NUC10i7FNH) from an Atomic Pi. I needed to manually install and configure Ubuntu on my hardware there is an issue where you cannot boot from the NVMe drive.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading Home Assistant hardware in 2020</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/upgrading-home-assistant-hardware-in-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 09:01:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/upgrading-home-assistant-hardware-in-2020/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded or swapped my Home Assistant hardware more times than I want to count.
