With that said you will always get my honest feedback about the pros and cons about these editors. About a month ago I started writing the new AngularJS based spa app for Exceptionless 2.0. While learning about AngularJS I looked around and used several editors to see which one worked the best. I&amp;rsquo;ll break down the editors that I used and conclude which one I liked the best.</description></item><item><title>Exceptionless Goes Open Source</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/programming/exceptionless-goes-open-source/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2014 13:33:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/programming/exceptionless-goes-open-source/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a big day at Exceptionless. We are super excited to announce that we are open sourcing the Exceptionless code! That&amp;rsquo;s right, now you can hack on our real-time error reporting tool yourself.
Too many apps are throwing too many errors out there, resulting in confused users, lost business, and endless frustration.
We believe Exceptionless can help the development community become more in-tune with their code by making those errors more transparent, trackable, and squashable.</description></item><item><title>How-to open a Visual Studio Document Window using the Visual Studio API</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/programming/how-to-open-a-visual-studio-document-window-using-the-visual-studio-api/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2011 20:24:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/programming/how-to-open-a-visual-studio-document-window-using-the-visual-studio-api/</guid><description>I had spent considerable time trying to open a new document window and then set the document text to the result of the generated template text.

According to Microsoft this functionality needs to be provided by the custom editor as well as the GoTo Line dialog will need to be implemented as there is no &amp;ldquo;official public extension point&amp;rdquo;. This makes sense if you are taking over control of the editor but I feel that Microsoft should expose this dialog.</description></item><item><title>Announcing The CodeSmith Generator 6.0 Visual Studio Template Editor</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/programming/announcing-the-codesmith-generator-6.0-visual-studio-template-editor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2011 18:57:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/programming/announcing-the-codesmith-generator-6.0-visual-studio-template-editor/</guid><description>We are very excited to announce that CodeSmith Generator 6.0 will feature a built-in Visual Studio CodeSmith Generator Template Editor on top of our existing Visual Studio Integration.

In this example we will create a new Webpage for each entity that we generate. This page will contain a LinqDataSource control and an ASP.NET GridView control that will display data from a corresponding entity that we generated. I always recommend that you use the PLINQO API when writing templates that interact with code generated by PLINQO as this ensures that the code generated has the proper names and associations and or types.</description></item><item><title>How-to: Create a new Oracle User</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/programming/how-to-create-a-new-oracle-user/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2011 13:09:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/programming/how-to-create-a-new-oracle-user/</guid><description>Every now and then I need to create a new Oracle user to test the CodeSmith Generator OracleSchemaProvider.

It had to deal with the CodeSmith CSLA templates when you set **UseMemberVariables **to true. The error is quite obscure and not very intuitive as the signs of a bug are only found when you check to see if your business object IsValid. The scenario in this case is when you set a required managed property, the rules never fully evaluate the set value.</description></item><item><title>CodeSmith Generator supports Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 RTM!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/programming/codesmith-generator-supports-microsoft-visual-studio-2010-rtm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2010 17:39:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/programming/codesmith-generator-supports-microsoft-visual-studio-2010-rtm/</guid><description>We have been working with Microsoft over the past few months to ensure that CodeSmith Generator works with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.
