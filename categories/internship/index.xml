It took a while to clean up the mess even with determined family members and friends. In the near future I will be trying to get some pictures up on facebook of the mess. Now that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry too much about that, I can focus my attention on school, development, and relaxation.</description></item><item><title>My Last Day</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/my-last-day/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2007 15:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/my-last-day/</guid><description>Today was my last day at Telligent as many of you already know. During this internship I learned many things that one can never learn by watching the television or going to college. Here are a few things I learned from some certain individuals:
How to act in a corporate environment (I would like to see college teach that!) How to express my ideas in a more appealing way. Keep my desk nailed and chained to the floor.</description></item><item><title>Heading back home to a natural disaster</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/heading-back-home-to-a-natural-disaster/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2007 14:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/heading-back-home-to-a-natural-disaster/</guid><description>Lately back home the flooding has been pretty terrible, in 3 days I will be flying back home to all this flooding. However Last night, I received two phone calls from my brother and dad, informing me that a tornado had taken out our shop and garage and had also hit the addition onto our house. I was pretty bummed about this whole situation until I found out that my 1967 Barracuda was flattened.</description></item><item><title>One Week Left</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/one-week-left/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2007 13:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/one-week-left/</guid><description>This coming Saturday I&amp;rsquo;m leaving on a jet plane to head back to good ole&amp;rsquo; Wisconsin. I&amp;rsquo;m going to miss everything about Telligent, a lot. It became my extended family. I have truly learned a lot about Telligent like:
How to act in a corporate environment How many great employees there are How everyone is really intelligent Anyone can tap into another&amp;rsquo;s knowledge During this past week, my fellow interns, who I work with daily, have started to head back to class.</description></item><item><title>Graffiti</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/graffiti/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2007 13:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/graffiti/</guid><description>During the past week we had a hack-a-thon event at Telligent headquarters. At the beginning of the week, I kept hearing small snippets of Graffiti. So I asked Jason Alexander what it was, and even though he was secretive about it. All he said is that it&amp;rsquo;s a CMS solution.
During our hack-a-thon, Graffiti was shown off to all the Telligenti who were in town, most of us had no clue that Graffiti even existed.</description></item><item><title>Settling For Second Place.</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/settling-for-second-place/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2007 13:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/settling-for-second-place/</guid><description>During last week when all the remote Telligenti were in the office, we had the first ever Telligent hack-a-thon. The target of this coding event was to add any feature you thought Graffiti (A new CMS solution) should have. The hack-a-thon at first, was only going to be one prize, which went to the best hacked submission for Graffiti. However, after more than 15 great submissions, Telligent decided the top three submissions would get an 8gig IPhone.</description></item><item><title>The All nighter</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-all-nighter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2007 10:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-all-nighter/</guid><description>Yesterday, Telligent had a hack-a-thon; and I&amp;rsquo;m very happy that they let an intern participate. I ended up staying up all night and implementing a project with the amazing markup and designer extraordinaire Ken Hanson.
I feel like the project that Ken and I developed was pretty solid and cool, However there are many brilliant minds that work at Telligent and most of them had their own projects. Some projects were pretty spectacular, so only time will tell who will win an 8GB iPhone.</description></item><item><title>Are your flash objects stealing your screen?</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/are-your-flash-objects-stealing-your-screen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Aug 2007 13:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/are-your-flash-objects-stealing-your-screen/</guid><description>The past week here, in Dallas, has been the busiest so far. I have been working on a new navigation bar for Community Server Enterprise Reporting. I also have been making phone calls and getting everything in place for when school starts.
In other news, Telligent is flying in all the remote employees. They should all be here by tonight, so tomorrow will be a really fun day; meeting all the Telligent employees.</description></item><item><title>The G35 experience</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-g35-experience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Aug 2007 14:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-g35-experience/</guid><description>Some of you might be thinking of a top secret Logitech product. I know I was when I heard the utterance &amp;ldquo;G35.&amp;rdquo; The G35 is a pretty sweet car and thanks to Donnie, in sales, I was lucky enough to get my first ride in one today. I have noticed that a lot of people here in Texas own a G35. Back home no one has one. In fact, I saw my first one when I arrived in Dallas.</description></item><item><title>The FileSystemWatcher class and medium trust.</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-filesystemwatcher-class-and-medium-trust/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2007 19:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-filesystemwatcher-class-and-medium-trust/</guid><description>This morning I sat down and started looking at why Community Server Enterprise Reporting was having problems running under medium trust. I kept on thinking something is majorly wrong if Community Server can run under medium trust and we can&amp;rsquo;t. I figured that all the reflection we use in Community Server Enterprise Reporting was causing the problems. Then I remembered that Community Server uses reflection. If Community Server uses reflection in a couple places then that&amp;rsquo;s not the reason Enterprise Reporting is blowing up.</description></item><item><title>Product Documentation</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/product-documentation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2007 13:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/product-documentation/</guid><description>This afternoon I started on creating the documentation for how to customize Community Server Enterprise Reporting. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be working on this for a while, because there are so many things one can customize, like:
Multiple database connections, Declarative report model, Enabling and disabling reports, Configuring reports, And much more! One thing that I have noticed over the past couple of years is that a lot of the documentation running in the wild is usually not that good.</description></item><item><title>Caching and What It Can Do For Your Product</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/caching-and-what-it-can-do-for-your-product/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2007 15:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/caching-and-what-it-can-do-for-your-product/</guid><description>Today I updated Community Server Enterprise Reporting caching framework to use Telligent&amp;rsquo;s updated caching framework. This updated caching framework is truly amazing; it can handle many more requests and data than the previous version.
After updating Community Server Enterprise Reporting, I started to see if the caching framework could handle more than what we were previously testing. Let me be the first to say that you can run every report we have and cache all of it with ease.</description></item><item><title>I am beginning to like the idea of shipping...</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/i-am-beginning-to-like-the-idea-of-shipping/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Aug 2007 15:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/i-am-beginning-to-like-the-idea-of-shipping/</guid><description>I bet you all thought that I was going to talk about shipping Community Sever Enterprise Reporting. I would, but then I would be lying and I don&amp;rsquo;t lie. This morning I shipped a fifty pound package back home. I am so happy that Adam and I decided that we would ship clothes and extra stuff that we have acquired down here, back home. My return flight should now be about fifty pounds lighter!</description></item><item><title>Automated Unit Testing</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/automated-unit-testing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2007 16:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/automated-unit-testing/</guid><description>Automated Unit testing is one subject that I do not know too much about. I was wishing this summer that we would get the chance to unit test the Community Server Enterprise Reporting project. We will see what the near future brings; I think we are not unit testing because the code is constantly changing. Once we get a little further down the road, I can see us running some unit tests on our project.</description></item><item><title>Repeater Control, Is it really that Dynamic?</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/repeater-control-is-it-really-that-dynamic/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jul 2007 10:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/repeater-control-is-it-really-that-dynamic/</guid><description>My question to everyone, Is the Repeater control dynamic enough to create custom tables on the fly? When I think of dynamic it&amp;rsquo;s something you have complete control over. And can change the display at anytime during execution. Please note that I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are multiple ways one can accomplish what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for, this is the way I choose to do it.
The one thing about the repeater control is it&amp;rsquo;s great for making data that has a unique predefined header and footer.</description></item><item><title>Cryptography!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/cryptography/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2007 16:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/cryptography/</guid><description>I had so much fun last night, Jason Alexander is so awesome. He took us to Dave and Busters last night! I think I had the most fun out of everyone there (Interns, Jason, Rob, and Snelson Stopped by for a minute). I�ve really never been to a place that big before, the only place that I�ve been to that was even remotely in the same category was chucky cheese in like 4th grade.</description></item><item><title>The Rules of Subversion (SVN)!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-rules-of-subversion-svn/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2007 16:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-rules-of-subversion-svn/</guid><description>I had quite the experience today, for one I committed the Community Server Enterprise Reporting Installer into the Repository of Community Server&amp;rsquo;s Installer. EEK! So I quickly did a &amp;ldquo;revert&amp;rdquo; on the folder to what it previously was before I had changed anything.
So here is the story on how it all happened. A few days ago I grabbed down the newest Community Server revision off of svn and copied the installer folder from CS into our project and started rewriting the installer for our project.</description></item><item><title>Community Server Enterprise Reporting Release Date</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/community-server-enterprise-reporting-release-date/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2007 23:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/community-server-enterprise-reporting-release-date/</guid><description>Telligent let the word out and posted a release date on CommunityServer.org. Around September 1st we will be releasing beta one of Community Server Enterprise Reporting. For the past two days I have been working on the installer for Community Server Enterprise Reporting. Hopefully tomorrow morning I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the small little bit of work that still needs to be done. That is if nothing else jumps out at me!
Around noon, nine of us went out to Purple Cow for lunch.</description></item><item><title>Oh Snap!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/oh-snap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2007 14:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/oh-snap/</guid><description>Today I heard a few words being yelled out into the hallway from a fellow intern. When this happens, I always take the time off and investigate because I know something has gone wrong. In this case, Andrew broke the build again today.
The build breaker wasn&amp;rsquo;t a programming bug, he just forgot to close Visual Studio, so it never saved the project file. This caused the build to break because the project file contains what&amp;rsquo;s included in the project.</description></item><item><title>A glimpse of Community Server Enterprise Reporting!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/a-glimpse-of-community-server-enterprise-reporting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jul 2007 10:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/a-glimpse-of-community-server-enterprise-reporting/</guid><description>I believe that the other interns and I have done a really great job this week! We have sat down and got a ton of work done in a short amount of time. After the meeting on Friday with Jason Alexander and Rob Howard, I could see it that we are where we need to be. Rob Howard even announced on his blog that he was going to show off some screenshots this weekend!</description></item><item><title>What would we do without Air Conditioning?</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/what-would-we-do-without-air-conditioning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2007 22:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/what-would-we-do-without-air-conditioning/</guid><description>As one might suspect the weather here in Dallas is starting to return to normal. We have had three days of fairly nice weather with only a little bit of rain falling today. I can feel that August is going to bring some warm weather. I really don&amp;rsquo;t mind warm weather that much, because I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be in where it&amp;rsquo;s nice and cool.
When you tell someone that your living down in Texas they are always like &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s going to be so 110 outside everyday&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Tellicamp: Bring your sleeping bag and toothbrush!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/tellicamp-bring-your-sleeping-bag-and-toothbrush/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2007 17:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/tellicamp-bring-your-sleeping-bag-and-toothbrush/</guid><description>The weather during the past two days has been absolutely spectacular! I wish we were a little closer to the gulf so I could take a quick ride to the beach.
I really like the new task website (Tellicamp); I know exactly what myself and co-workers have to get done by the end of the day! The Telliterns have quickly killed the list of TODO&amp;rsquo;s. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait till see tomorrows feedback from Rob Howard, Jason Alexander and the rest of the Telligent.</description></item><item><title>What a beautiful day!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/what-a-beautiful-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jul 2007 15:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/what-a-beautiful-day/</guid><description>Today was one of those rare days when you wake up and it actually doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like it is going to rain. Well maybe not so rare here normally, but it sure has been so far this summer.
All the guys besides Andrew continued working on the UI and its starting to really take shape. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait till Friday and look back on what Community Server Enterprise Reporting looked like yesterday.</description></item><item><title>Looking at multiviews of reporting</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/looking-at-multiviews-of-reporting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jul 2007 09:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/looking-at-multiviews-of-reporting/</guid><description>Yesterday was a pretty interesting day if you ask me. For one we set up a new system to keep track of tasks, bugs and feedback, which is pretty sweet. Not only will this help us manage what needs to be done, it will change the way our scrum meetings are held.
I worked on the User Interface for adding a report with Howdy; it uses MultiViews and reminds me of a wizard!</description></item><item><title>My first ever IHOP...</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/my-first-ever-ihop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2007 16:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/my-first-ever-ihop/</guid><description>We got notice late last night that Jason Alexander was not feeling so well and let us know that Bill Robertson would be taking charge for the day.
I worked on fixing some bugs earlier this morning and that was quite the learning experience. This afternoon Andrew and I continued working on the task engine, and then I attempted to run the task engine in a configuration that we have never done before, remote source db to remote destination db.</description></item><item><title>Flooding the North Dallas .NET User Group</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/flooding-the-north-dallas-net-user-group/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2007 22:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/flooding-the-north-dallas-net-user-group/</guid><description>Last night I attended the North Dallas .NET User Group (NDDNUG) after Shane Henderson maneuvered his truck like a boat down the road because the streets were practically flooded. This was the first user group of any kind that I have attended. Luckily the topic was on something I knew a lot about, Windows Vista. I&amp;rsquo;m a Windows guy. I always have to be running on the newest possible thing. Even if that means that I have to run an alpha version of Windows.</description></item><item><title>Movie and game night</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/movie-and-game-night/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2007 15:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/movie-and-game-night/</guid><description>Howdy and I worked today on implementing a declarative report model into Community Server Enterprise Reporting. One can now choose to define a report in xml or add the class assembly information into the report configuration section.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to game night. A bunch of the guys are going to be playing WOW and some people are going to play Counter-Strike: Source. I don&amp;rsquo;t play video games very much anymore so we will see the outcome.</description></item><item><title>Game Night Tomorrow Night!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/game-night-tomorrow-night/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2007 17:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/game-night-tomorrow-night/</guid><description>Today was another case of the Mondays! Just kidding! This morning we had our scrum meeting and found ourselves with a lot of tasks that still needed to be checked in.
Today for lunch, Telligent catered in &amp;ldquo;Red Hot &amp;amp; Blue&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Who names their company &amp;ldquo;Red Hot &amp;amp; Blue&amp;rdquo;? I think they could have come up with a better name, but anyways we were lucky enough to taste their BBQ Brisket and BBQ Smoked Turkey.</description></item><item><title>The one and only Community Server Enterprise Reporting Presentation</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-one-and-only-community-server-enterprise-reporting-presentation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jul 2007 16:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-one-and-only-community-server-enterprise-reporting-presentation/</guid><description>Today we all shoved into the C# conference room after we all devoured some Olive Garden. It was really good. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had breadsticks or visited Olive Garden in quite some time. Our presentation lasted about an hour; overall I think it went pretty well.
David Penton and Bill Robertson found some things that we are going to change in Community Server Enterprise Reporting. The Telligent listeners raised some valid scenarios that we will have to take into consideration for version one and two.</description></item><item><title>C-Rollin through PowerPoint's</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/c-rollin-through-powerpoints/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2007 15:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/c-rollin-through-powerpoints/</guid><description>Today was a big change; The Tellitern crew sat in the VB .Net conference room and created a PowerPoint. Tomorrow, if you&amp;rsquo;re in the office, come and support the three month &amp;ldquo;FTE&amp;rdquo; (cough Darren cough) Interns. We will be presenting Community Server Enterprise Reporting (Tattletale) to interested Telligent employees.
Jason Alexander and the interns went to C-Rolls Sushi for lunch. I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to really like Sushi; the lady working at C-Rolls made my day by providing me a plastic cheater clip for my chop sticks.</description></item><item><title>Happy 4th</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/happy-4th/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jul 2007 14:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/happy-4th/</guid><description>Tomorrow most of the people at Telligent will be taking the day off, however there are a lot of hard working people at Telligent that are still coming in. We were offered to take off a little bit earlier today if we wanted. This was pretty cool of Telligent. I was unable to take off early due to a couple of the guys came up to me and asked me if I wanted to play some counter-strike: source.</description></item><item><title>It's a case of the Mondays</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/its-a-case-of-the-mondays/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2007 20:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/its-a-case-of-the-mondays/</guid><description>Over the weekend Ryan and I made some major changes to how we implement reports. It took a little bit of time to fix those 689 errors that had to be changed in order for us to be able to compile.
Today we had a small meeting with the other interns and discussed the changes that we made to the reporting base classes. And then we went I went onto correcting a list of things that needed to be done.</description></item><item><title>Rafain is awesome</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/rafain-is-awesome/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2007 16:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/rafain-is-awesome/</guid><description>Today was not the ordinary Friday that I usually look forward to. To start out the day Jason Alexander asked us where we wanted to eat. The interns took a quick vote and decided to go to Rafain. I really love Rafain because it is so delicious. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know what Rafain is? It is a Brazilian steakhouse that ROCKS! The interns as a whole ate way too much including Jason (who was on a diet).</description></item><item><title>Welcome to the Rain Forest we call Texas</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/welcome-to-the-rain-forest-we-call-texas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2007 22:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/welcome-to-the-rain-forest-we-call-texas/</guid><description>As we were watching the news today, we found out that we are about to surpass all previous rainfall records for Texas. That is pretty amazing considering its summer time and Texas is usually a desert during the end of June.
Howdy and I cranked out the rest of the reports that we were working on. I also added some more functionality to our framework. I am looking forward to the weekend so I can laugh at all the people who bought the IPhone, and watch the new Die Hard.</description></item><item><title>STORM! We do not own an amphibious car.</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/storm-we-do-not-own-an-amphibious-car/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2007 23:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/storm-we-do-not-own-an-amphibious-car/</guid><description>I had my first bagel today; I don�t ever recall having one before, so if I did it was way long ago. I thought they the beagles that I ate were pretty delicious.
Howdy and I are getting pretty good at writing some fairly complex SQL queries. I think that by the time this internship is over. I can pretty much sit down and write any query that I could think of off the top of my head.</description></item><item><title>Stormy weather returns.</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/stormy-weather-returns/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2007 16:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/stormy-weather-returns/</guid><description>Dallas normally doesn&amp;rsquo;t get to much rain during the summer, so it must be something out of the ordinary for the locals. I kind of like it because the rain brings down the overall temperature.
Everyone continued working on SQL queries for the reports today. I am noticing that I have no problem writing SQL statements. Howdy and I are learning tips and tricks as we progress through the queries. I really wish that colleges would teach SQL to students in the Computer Science major.</description></item><item><title>Paintball: where techies of all ages become kids.</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/paintball-where-techies-of-all-ages-become-kids/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jun 2007 20:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/paintball-where-techies-of-all-ages-become-kids/</guid><description>On Friday, Telligent gave everyone the day off to play paintball. I had a lot of fun playing, and enjoyed seeing people older than me running, and diving into a new &amp;ldquo;safe area.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m guessing a lot of Telligenti including myself were sore for the remainder of the weekend. The soreness was definitely worth it; thanks Telligent!
After riding into work today with Rick Reszler, we noticed that Adam had a new office.</description></item><item><title>Anyone wanna play a round of musical offices?</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/anyone-wanna-play-a-round-of-musical-offices/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2007 15:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/anyone-wanna-play-a-round-of-musical-offices/</guid><description>Today was a lot of fun, have you ever heard about musical chairs? How about musical offices? That&amp;rsquo;s right! I was lucky enough to play musical offices today! W00T! I believe Telligent owns the patent on this game.
During all of this, Andrew and I wrote the code for a custom control in the Ping Pong and game room number 2. I&amp;rsquo;m really glad that I own a laptop.
Tomorrow most of Telligent is taking the day off to play paint ball.</description></item><item><title>Mole!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/mole/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2007 23:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/mole/</guid><description>The task engine has been completed, and I sure do notice when a bulk insert is running because we currently have my machine running as the main SQL Server. This week were focusing on the UI, Charting and such things like that.
There was so much drama at Telligent today. One might have thought that Telligent was actually the CIA, seeking out a mole in the organization. One might ask who that mole was, it was Adam, and he even had me his roommate fooled.</description></item><item><title>Cloudy</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/cloudy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jun 2007 17:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/cloudy/</guid><description>We all knew that we would need to rewrite the task framework; it was somewhat messy and needed an overhaul. Ryan Hoffman and I overhauled it last night in a few hours. So this morning we quickly fixed most of the queries to use the new engine. Let me be the first to say, these tasks are quick!
However there are some tasks need to update data that was imported previously (counters and other such data).</description></item><item><title>Our first review day!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/our-first-review-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jun 2007 08:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/our-first-review-day/</guid><description>Today at our scrum meeting Jason Alexander told us that we would be reviewing Tattletale to Scott Watermasysk and Rob Howard after lunch. So we spent a part of the day cleaning up the code (which was needed a little bit). Soon we realized when we were testing our reports during the cleanup, that someone updated our db schema and deleted some tables, and that we would need to rerun the tasks.</description></item><item><title>Houston: We have t-minus two months!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/houston-we-have-t-minus-two-months/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jun 2007 18:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/houston-we-have-t-minus-two-months/</guid><description>I really cannot believe that a month has passed since I arrived in Texas. The internship is 33% completed and it seems like three percent.
Today we cranked out reports and we only have two left. Everyone thought that it was going to take three days to write one report. However, Andrew and I have written twenty plus reports in one week! The same goes for the rest of the gang.</description></item><item><title>SELECT PostTitle AS 'This Is An Okay Title' FROM Tattletale_ForumData WHERE PostTitle IS NOT NULL</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/select-posttitle-as-this-is-an-okay-title-from-tattletale-forumdata-where-posttitle-is-not-null/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jun 2007 17:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/select-posttitle-as-this-is-an-okay-title-from-tattletale-forumdata-where-posttitle-is-not-null/</guid><description>Today was another dreadful day of having problems with the task framework. We wrote four blog reports today, which is not nearly the amount that we have written in the past, but overall today I think I got a lot accomplished.
We all meet around 11:00 am this morning for our SCRUM meeting; a little late due to Ado had other meetings to attend to. We recognized that we had a few priority ten tasks that needed to be completed today.</description></item><item><title>The day the JOIN(s) died.</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-day-the-joins-died/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jun 2007 08:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-day-the-joins-died/</guid><description>After arriving to work with we started estimating how long our reports would take to complete. Little did we all know that we would run into problems soon enough. Telligent supplied us with a delicious and much appreciated breakfast this morning. After Ryan, Adam and I came back from lunch; we opened our car door and then heard a massive sound coming from Mother Nature. Right after this happened Adam said maybe we should go back and unplug some things.</description></item><item><title>Reports and Game night!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/reports-and-game-night/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jun 2007 11:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/reports-and-game-night/</guid><description>Today, we got into the office and worked on reports all day, we found a few flaws in our framework and made the necessary changes. This week we all have been estimating and recalculating how long it will take us to get the reports done. I like that we are doing this, so in future references when a client asks us how long something will take. We can estimate to the best of our abilities how long something should take and bill them accordingly.</description></item><item><title>Warm weather rocks!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/warm-weather-rocks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2007 16:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/warm-weather-rocks/</guid><description>I am happy to be back in Texas because it removed some of the distressing memories that were occurring at home. I woke up at 1:30 am on Sunday morning in order to get ready for my return to Dallas. The three hour drive was a little much considering my plane took off at 6:00 am. After flying through another turbulent flight, we touched down in around 8:20 am. From there Ryan came and picked me up and we went back to the apartment.</description></item><item><title>Back in Wisconsin.</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/back-in-wisconsin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2007 10:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/back-in-wisconsin/</guid><description>Yesterday I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to write a blog post, so here it is :). I focused on hooking up the web services so we could get onto the next task of writing reports. Telligent supplied its employee&amp;rsquo;s with pigs in a blanket for breakfast. It was really good. I had a lot of fun yesterday at work, it just seemed like everything was fitting into place.
I flew out around 5:30 after our airplane had to deal with customs for EVER before flying us to our destination.</description></item><item><title>The Perfect Day!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-perfect-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2007 17:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-perfect-day/</guid><description>Today was such a beautiful day! We walked outside our apartment this morning and the weather was so perfect it felt surreal. This morning we got introduced to our stand in project manager ado who will be filling in next week. I also exchanged my phone that split in two for a PPC-6700.
For lunch Delia and Laura took Adam, Ryan, and I out to Potbelly&amp;rsquo;s for some delicious food. And we all talked about our roller coaster experiences.</description></item><item><title>Headache +2, Me = 0</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/headache-2-me-0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2007 18:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/headache-2-me-0/</guid><description>I swear that this weekend just flew by; it is almost like I shut my eyes on Friday night and woke up this morning. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything this weekend, but watch a movie and relax after receiving some bad news. On Wednesday I&amp;rsquo;m flying back to Wisconsin for a few days. I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to put up some pictures.
Today, I worked on web services and even more on the User Interface.</description></item><item><title>Telligent turns Three!!!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/telligent-turns-three/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2007 17:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/telligent-turns-three/</guid><description>Today Telligent celebrated its third birthday by calling everyone into the ping pong room. Once we were all in there; it was revealed to us that there was a card board clone of Rob Howard. As soon as Rob Howard walked in the room he started laughing and the first words out of his mouth were &amp;ldquo;It was Tom wasn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;
Today, I continued working on the User Interface. However, I mostly focused on working with chained events/delegates and User Controls.</description></item><item><title>No rain... what a change!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/no-rain-what-a-change/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2007 17:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/no-rain-what-a-change/</guid><description>Today in Dallas, Texas we actually had a nice day. Although, it was cloudy when I checked but that is better than rain right?
My fellow interns came into my office a few times today and told me that I am a hard worker. Thanks! All that I can say is that I love the work we are doing and I am very committed to it. Last night, I ended up working on the User Interface until the master page was done.</description></item><item><title>The Community Server Enterprise Reporting User Interface!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-community-server-enterprise-reporting-user-interface/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2007 15:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/the-community-server-enterprise-reporting-user-interface/</guid><description>This morning we woke up and headed out the door like usual; however, a bird keeps on attacking Adam, so now every time we leave our apartment he sprints to the car. When we arrived at work it was nice and bright outside. But by the time we had devoured the breakfast that Telligent had bought for its employees and in our SCRUM meeting, it was pitch black!
It has been raining so much; a person visiting from Seattle might forget where he actually was.</description></item><item><title>Drop and Give me 40 lines of code!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/drop-and-give-me-40-lines-of-code/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2007 16:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/drop-and-give-me-40-lines-of-code/</guid><description>Today we had a very interesting SCRUM meeting; Jason Alexander reassured us that we have a ton of work to do, and not a lot of time to get it done. The interns know that we all will prevail! He assigned everyone in pairs to do pair programming (Extreme Programming).
Towards the end of this meeting, Jason assigned me and Kevin to work together on the Reporting User Interface. All I could think was wow; we get to define how the User Interface is laid out.</description></item><item><title>Initial database design done</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/initial-database-design-done/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2007 15:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/initial-database-design-done/</guid><description>As always we started the day with meetings. Today, we finished up the initial database design portion and actually started making tables and merging the data together. I suspect that we will have at least one maybe two days left of just classifying and merging data.
There were several things that I learned today, most of it was MS SQL commands like (sp_who, sp_lock, sp_helptext, kill 60). It is always nice to see the commands in action and get a detailed explanation of what they return and do.</description></item><item><title>Rain, Rain, and more Rain</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/rain-rain-and-more-rain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2007 16:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/rain-rain-and-more-rain/</guid><description>We started today off with another scrum meeting. I already have it drilled into my head to go there automatically at 9:30am. Today, I did not spend too much time at the computer because we were in the VB conference room all day going over reporting and database design. Tomorrow we will finally be almost done with the database design layout portion. The only thing left is meeting with the SQL gurus&amp;rsquo;s and talk about best practices and what would be the best way to accomplish our task.</description></item><item><title>More meetings and Sushi</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/more-meetings-and-sushi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2007 14:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/more-meetings-and-sushi/</guid><description>Today we had another Scrum meeting and another &amp;ldquo;Tattletale Design Session&amp;rdquo; that lasted for a few hours. We all had a lot of fun throwing even more ideas into what reports we can generate. I always liked the phrase &amp;ldquo;Design now, Code later&amp;rdquo;, and that is exactly what were doing. I sense that someone in the gang of interns has been really itching to code. Just give it time and we all will be eating, dreaming, and writing all sorts of code!</description></item><item><title>I am now an Telligent Intern!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/i-am-now-an-telligent-intern/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2007 18:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/i-am-now-an-telligent-intern/</guid><description>As some of you might be shocked that this is not a post about software releases and other such things. I have received an internship for this summer to work for Telligent Systems, Inc. They are located in Dallas, Texas. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Telligent is, then you obviously haven&amp;rsquo;t been in the .net world long enough.
I arrived in Dallas, Texas on Sunday May 20th; it was a pretty short flight out of Wisconsin to Texas about three hours.</description></item><item><title>Meetings, lunch, and more meetings!</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/meetings-lunch-and-more-meetings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2007 16:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/meetings-lunch-and-more-meetings/</guid><description>This morning I woke up ready for another day of learning anything and everything that I can get my hands on.
When we arrived at Telligent this morning, we all received an email stating that we would have scrum meetings everyday for the rest of the summer. So after the very short meeting about that dealt with the details of scrum development, we split paths and worked on individual tasks for about a half hour.</description></item><item><title>My first day at Telligent</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/my-first-day-at-telligent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2007 13:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/my-first-day-at-telligent/</guid><description>My first day at Telligent Systems, Inc. as intern has been pretty exciting! This morning all the interns listened to Jason Alexander as he gave us an orientation. He informed us with all the information we will would need to accomplish our goals while at Telligent Systems, Inc.
For all of you wondering what we interns will be working on this summer you will have to look no further. We will be working on a project codenamed Tattletale (Community Server Enterprise Reporting).</description></item></channel></rss>
