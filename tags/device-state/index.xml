If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend reading my previous blog post on sending Text-to-Speech notifications which dives a bit deeper on the optional accessibility Subflow this Flow consumes.
This automation normalizes all volume levels in my home based on the time of day using the Amazon Alexa Media Player Integration to bring in all my Amazon Echo and ecobee Switch+ devices into Home Assistant.</description></item><item><title>How-to send Text-to-Speech notifications with Home Assistant and Node-RED</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/how-to-send-text-to-speech-notifications-with-home-assistant-and-node-red/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 17:35:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/how-to-send-text-to-speech-notifications-with-home-assistant-and-node-red/</guid><description>Have you ever wanted to send Text-to-Speech (TTS) notifications with Home Assistant and Node-RED? In the sections below I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using Amazon Alexa Media Player Integration to send TTS notifications. Please note you can easily switch out the TTS integration to the one of your choosing and still use this Subflow (with a few tweaks).
This is one of my favorite Subflows as it can be used easily in a lot of automations.</description></item><item><title>Hello Home Automation, How-to detect battery levels with Node-RED</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/hello-home-automation-how-to-detect-battery-levels-with-node-red/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:39:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/hello-home-automation-how-to-detect-battery-levels-with-node-red/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start off 2020 by converting my blog to Hugo and start blogging again! This is my first of many posts on home automation! This post is going to cover generically detecting battery levels with Home Assistant and Node-RED.
TLDR: Use the Function node defined in the Node-RED snippet here to properly handle all the edge cases.
I decided to share my experiences based on seeing what others were doing in this thread.</description></item></channel></rss>
