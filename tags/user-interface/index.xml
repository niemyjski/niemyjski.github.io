We walked outside our apartment this morning and the weather was so perfect it felt surreal. This morning we got introduced to our stand in project manager ado who will be filling in next week. I also exchanged my phone that split in two for a PPC-6700.
For lunch Delia and Laura took Adam, Ryan, and I out to Potbelly&amp;rsquo;s for some delicious food. And we all talked about our roller coaster experiences.</description></item><item><title>How to make a UI "smarter"</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/how-to-make-a-ui-smarter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2006 16:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/how-to-make-a-ui-smarter/</guid><description>First off, I would like to clarify how bad I am at making UI&amp;rsquo;s (User Interfaces). It never has been my specialty, but I know when I come across a UI that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been thought out for the consumers needs. Since I&amp;rsquo;m a gamer I&amp;rsquo;d like to show you a UI from (Valve Software) that I really am disgusted with, but am forced to use it.
If you notice, that none of the filters are filled in and everything is being displayed correctly.</description></item></channel></rss>
