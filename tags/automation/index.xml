This is getting so common that someone created a website called Killed by Google. After Google shutdown Reader in 2013, I spent months trying to find a replacement. During this research I determined I should try to find solutions to services I use everyday that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be shut down in some board room over profit margins.</description></item><item><title>Building and maintaining a smart home presentation</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/building-and-maintaining-a-smart-home-presentation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 12:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/building-and-maintaining-a-smart-home-presentation/</guid><description>Here is a recent recording of a new talk I recently gave at North Dallas Developers on my experiences building and maintaining a smart home.

I&amp;rsquo;ve laid out all the information below on how you can use NFC Tags to automate other apps and devices as well!
I really like using Near Field Communication (NFC) for home or device based automations because it is really cheap and the possibilities are endless as you can place them in any environmental condition and on almost any physical object.</description></item><item><title>How-to normalize home volume levels with Node-RED</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/how-to-normalize-home-volume-levels-with-node-red/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2020 08:11:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/how-to-normalize-home-volume-levels-with-node-red/</guid><description>This post is going to cover normalizing all media_player volume levels with Home Assistant and Node-RED. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend reading my previous blog post on sending Text-to-Speech notifications which dives a bit deeper on the optional accessibility Subflow this Flow consumes.
This automation normalizes all volume levels in my home based on the time of day using the Amazon Alexa Media Player Integration to bring in all my Amazon Echo and ecobee Switch+ devices into Home Assistant.</description></item><item><title>How-to send Text-to-Speech notifications with Home Assistant and Node-RED</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/how-to-send-text-to-speech-notifications-with-home-assistant-and-node-red/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 17:35:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/how-to-send-text-to-speech-notifications-with-home-assistant-and-node-red/</guid><description>Have you ever wanted to send Text-to-Speech (TTS) notifications with Home Assistant and Node-RED? In the sections below I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using Amazon Alexa Media Player Integration to send TTS notifications. Please note you can easily switch out the TTS integration to the one of your choosing and still use this Subflow (with a few tweaks).
This is one of my favorite Subflows as it can be used easily in a lot of automations.</description></item><item><title>Let's talk about smart home accessibility</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/lets-talk-about-smart-home-accessibility/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 01:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/lets-talk-about-smart-home-accessibility/</guid><description>I define accessibility as a critical necessity to be inclusive to everyone. No matter how big or small the task, anyone should be able complete the task at hand regardless of the disability (e.g., vision, hearing, mobility, device access, language, etc).

I&amp;rsquo;d like to think I&amp;rsquo;ve taken steps both physically and monetarily to do so.
The Dreaded Power Bill Which is why one Wisconsin Winter day I opened my utility (gas and electric) bill and had a not so pleasant moment. Complete sticker shock at the $410 USD single month total, which was our highest bill yet.</description></item><item><title>Hello Home Automation, How-to detect battery levels with Node-RED</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/hello-home-automation-how-to-detect-battery-levels-with-node-red/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:39:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/hello-home-automation-how-to-detect-battery-levels-with-node-red/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start off 2020 by converting my blog to Hugo and start blogging again! This is my first of many posts on home automation! This post is going to cover generically detecting battery levels with Home Assistant and Node-RED.
TLDR: Use the Function node defined in the Node-RED snippet here to properly handle all the edge cases.
I decided to share my experiences based on seeing what others were doing in this thread.</description></item></channel></rss>
