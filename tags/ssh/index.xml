I thought it was interesting and something that I would use if I was building a smart device from scratch. I thought of all the things I could do, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like the idea of all the maintenance I could foresee.
ESPHome is a system to control your ESP8266/ESP32 by simple yet powerful configuration files and control them remotely through Home Automation systems.</description></item><item><title>Installing Home Assistant on Ubuntu</title><link>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/installing-home-assistant-on-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 02:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/installing-home-assistant-on-ubuntu/</guid><description>NOTE: This post has been updated on May 26th to use Docker-CE instead of Snap.
Home Assistant has stated they will no longer support this installation method but there currently is no other way to use external storage.
I recently upgraded my Home Assistant server to an Intel NUC 10 Performance Kit (NUC10i7FNH) from an Atomic Pi. I needed to manually install and configure Ubuntu on my hardware there is an issue where you cannot boot from the NVMe drive.</description></item></channel></rss>
